# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 

Analysis of Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

The analysis focuses on reviews from the "Digital Video Game v1_00" dataset.

## Results
The dataset for analysis had no vine reviews. The analysis was manually verified and double checked to confirm this result. Further details in the summary section of the analysis.

## Summary

The analysis could not confirm nor deny any bias due to lack of data in this category.

It is unknown why there were 0 vine reviews, but I suspect the vine program may have been discontinued for this category. More research into the vine program and further analysis into other categories are needed.
